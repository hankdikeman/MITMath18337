## Intro to 18.337
08/08/21

### Course intended to teach two disciplines
1. Parallel computing: using multiple CPU nodes as opposed to serial computing
2. Scientific ML: combining scientific computing with machine learning methodologies


This course teaches by using exercises in the Julia programming language

### Intended audience
Should know one of the following disciplines before taking this course
1. Parallel computing
2. Machine learning
3. Numerical Analysis


### Course Material
- 50% homework
- 10% project proposal
- 40% final project

The final project will be in SIAM journal format (10-20 pages) and is intended to be of quality acceptable to a machine learning journal/conference. **Example Projects**:

- Fast regex implementation
- Math library primitives (exp, pow)
- Related to the research already conducting

### Lecture Material
In general, lectures and homework will start by implementing from scratch and moving onto already-implemented libraries for future work
1. **Week 1**: Basics of scientific ML and Parallel computation (including multithreading basics)
2. **Week 2**: Continuous dynamical systems and algorithms to solve them (including stiff ODE systems)
3. **Week 3**: Differentiable programming and distributed parallel programming (including MPI)
4. **Week 4**: Applications of parallelization and scientific ML, how to optimize programs
