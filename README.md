# MITMath18337

This repo contains the programs developed for the parallel computing/scientific ML class 18.337 on [MIT OpenCourseware](https://mitmath.github.io/18337/)

1. Lecture 1
   - [Lecture 1 Notes](Lecture1/Notes_Lecture1/): contains typed notes on intro to course, intro to Julia, and some Julia resources
   - [Lecture 1 Programs](Lecture1/Programs_Lecture1/): contains some simple Julia stuff, my first Julia program, an environment with some autodiff tools
2. Lecture 2
   - [Lecture 2 Notes](Lecture1/Notes_Lecture2/): contains notes on optimizing serial code, with a bit of a special emphasis in optimizing compiled Julia programs
   - [Lecture 2 Programs](Lecture1/Programs_Lecture2/): some optimization work for several ODE systems, a fully optimized (cached variables, inplace ops, inference engine optimization) PDE system implementation
3. Lecture 3
   - [Lecture 3 Notes](Lecture3/Notes_Lecture3/): typed notes on an intro to scientific machine learning, with a quick intro to `Flux.jl` and details on a common scientific ML framework
   - [Lecture 3 Programs](Lecture3/Programs_Lecture3/): some simple implementations of trivial neural networks, and a PINN for a damped oscillator system
